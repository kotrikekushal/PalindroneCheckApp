# PalindromeCheckerApp

##  Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an application that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward (Example: madam, 121).

##  Project Procedure

1. Created a new project named **PalindromeCheckerApp**.
2. Designed input functionality to accept a string or number from the user.
3. Implemented logic to reverse the given input.
4. Compared the original input with the reversed value.
5. Displayed the result based on comparison.
6. Tested the program with different test cases.
7. Updated the README.md file with project details.

##  Flow of Project

1. Start the program.
2. User enters a string or number.
3. Program stores the input value.
4. Reverse the input.
5. Compare original value with reversed value.
6. If both are equal → Display "It is a Palindrome".
7. Else → Display "It is Not a Palindrome".
8. End the program.
